## 🤝 UDHAAR Community

### What is UDHAAR?  
**UDHAAR** is a unique feature of Farmer Care — a peer-to-peer lending and borrowing community for agricultural tools and machinery. It’s built to help all farmers, especially smallholders, access equipment that might otherwise be out of reach.

### How Does It Work?  
- **List a Tool:** Have a tractor, harvester, or any tool that’s idle? List it on UDHAAR for others to borrow.
- **Borrow a Tool:** Need equipment for your field? Browse available tools and send a borrow request.
- **Manage Requests:** Easily manage lending/borrowing requests, track status, and connect with fellow farmers.
- **Fair & Transparent:** See rental fees, tool details, and contact information for smooth transactions.

> 💡 **Big farmers can support small farmers by lending unused equipment, building a stronger, collaborative rural community!**

**Key Screens:**  
- Featured tools on the home page  
- Easy actions: List your tool / Borrow a tool  
- Manage requests (as lender or borrower)  
- Contact info exchange for coordination
